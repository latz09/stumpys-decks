        review: 'I hired Stumpys for a new deck build.  The overall quality and attention to detail exceeded my expectations.  While the crew was very efficient, they took the time to build it the right way.  Dennis and his team are professional, experienced deck builders who take pride in their work.  I highly recommend Stumpys for your deck project.'

        review: 'Stumpys replaced our old, rotting deck for us, and they were great! Dennis was super informative when he came out to give us an estimate, then Daniel and the team were really good and fast. Our teardown and replacement with a new cedar deck and aluminum railing only took three days! The new deck is beautiful.'
